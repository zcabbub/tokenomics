***Def***:[1]
*Tokens always have*:
- an issuer
- a substrate (carrier)
- a system it is meaningful in
- a value to someone
- some way to use them

**Issues**: [2]
- There is no real research on what's the best way to design an efficient system for maximizing *economic, political and social* coordination gain. 
- token launches are dependent on entities tied to the current legal systems (that offers a certain *protection*, but is systematically slow)
		- no way(yet) to automatically create themselves when the market expresses interest for it
		- they currently have extremely low barriers to entry
```ad-tip
title: check how traditional companies get protection from the sovereign state
collapse: close

try to replicate it without losing the speed of automated blockchain coordination
