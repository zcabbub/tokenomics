### *Internal actors*:

##### ***Essential***:
- ##### Community
	*Incentives*: 
		- buy Valyu to be part of Valyu community
- ##### Data Buyers
- ##### Data providers
- ##### Curators/Stakers
		- also called Internal Liquidity Providers
		- have their knowledge tested, to inspire trustful choices/staking.
	*Incentives:*
		- stake Valyu and get datatokens to:
			- receive a part of the 
			- be part of a dataset community (*e.g. interested people about a boardgames data*) (Supporters)

##### ***Optional***:
	- these services can be centralized and create revenue streams
- ##### Data labellers
		- label data for Valyu rewards?
- ##### Data processers/cleaners
- ##### Data decentralized trainers
		- offer compute-to-data
		- potentially consisting in nodes for [[Federated Learning]]


### *External actors*:
- ##### Resellers/Speculators
		- on external exchanges

```ad-question:

```
	
- ##### External Liquidity Providers
		- external market makers
```ad-danger
title: are they a danger to our bonding curve determined price?
collapse: closed

if our mechanism is inherently more fair/better than a classic Double-Auction, we should not worry. 

```
	



```ad-tip
title: maybe divide stakers from supporters
*same actor at the moment, merged incentives*
- stakers are supporters who do it to make a profit
- supporters want to get into the passionate community around a topic (e.g. people who like butterflies)
```

```ad-note
title: community incentive idea
Create NFTs that are not bonded and represent access to the passionate community around a topic.

* Topics are created after labelling, and are a way of indexing data into categories

* Offer dataset community NFTs for free to stakers/curators since they are already supporters. Curators should have their Web 3.0 and topic knowledge tested somehow, since this is what people will trust when they will see the a popular curated/staked dataset.

***Use case example***:
Bob is a butterfly passionate and wants to find other people as passionate as him. 

He will probably search facebook groups and pages, reddit communities, anything to find other passionates. 
But these do not guarantee that he will find people that are as skilled, and therefore credibly opinionated, as he is.
He will then realize that people using, exchanging and therefore understanding data will be much more suitable for him.
He will look into Valyu and get an *access token* to the Discord channel where other butterfly data passionate discuss and exchange ideas.
