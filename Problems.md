 ### problems
1) how do we stop a data provider/seller from affecting the dataset after selling (i.e. we issue tokens for it)?
	- created a hashing/zkp system 
		- *which allows us to verify the data without seeing it*
	- economical incentives 
		- *e.g. taking tokens away*
	- incentives based on ratings 
		- *e.g. punishments such as platform ban*
