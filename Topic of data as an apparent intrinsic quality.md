***Data about nothing is nothing.***

Since we want to offer opportunities for profit in a marketplace, I believe is a good idea to place topic as an intrinsic quality of apparent value. It allows the same opportunity for everyone, and specialists on the respective topic can take advantage of their hardly achieved knowledge asymmetry/competitional advantage.

We can consider the case of having the topic of a dataset being part of the latent value of a data product. However, in this situation you will only be left with qualitative attributes of data that can be very similar for most datasets. For example, how clean and 'rigurous' a dataset is structured. Considering that in the long term an efficient market would lead people to converge to a high quality standard for all uploaded datasets, we would end with all datasets having the same or extremely close ownership price (staked). On the other hand, if the topic is taken into account at the point of staking, people will have something to speculate on and create the positive-sum game.

Continuing the asset parallel with oil, we can think about a data product as an oil field. Therefore, the hidden potential(barrels of oil in the ground) can be quantified to infer future income. As the value of an oil field can be quantified based on the geographical position, the topic of the data(financial, healthcare data, sciences, etc.) defines its potential use cases and future revenue.

As we cannot perform market differential/comparative pricing due to lack of liquidity, we have to **initially** derive the value of each topic/area using proxies. This is part of the Expansionary policy of the system, which can also be called pre-Liquidity Phase.


###### How coefficients are calculated based on the current policy?

Each topic would have a coefficient/multiplier that infers the potential in this area. These coefficients are designed to change logitudinally as time passes, and their values are modified depending on different metrics that infer demand, such as popularity (*pre-Liquidity Phase*) or similar trades (*post-Liquidity Phase*). These metrics can initially be derived alternatively from proxies that describe popularity, e.g. sentiment analysis from social media.

*For example*: Data about war is more valuable now than data about butterflies, just because of popularity. 



### Details:

##### Pre-liquidity proxy valuation for topic coefficients:
proxies that infer demand:
- popularity
- *shapley: scrape kaggle in order to check similar features in different datasets and average them somehow

proxies that infer supply:


##### Post-liquidity proxy valuation for topic coefficients:
- differential comparative pricing, i.e. market pricing
