The profit of firm $(i$) is given by $\pi_{i}=(p_{i}-c)D_{i}(p_{i},p_{j})$) if there are no fixed costs, where $(D_{i}(p_{i},p_{j})$) is the demand faced by firm $(i$) if firm $(i$) charges price $(p_{i}$) and firm $(j$) charges price $(p_{j}$). The demand $(D_{i}(p_{i},p_{j})$) faced by firm $(i$) depends on the prices of both firms:

1.  If firm $(i$) charges a higher price than firm $(j$) ($(p_{i}>p_{j}$)) all consumers buy from firm $(j$), firm $(i$) has no demand and makes a profit of zero.
2.  If firm $(j$) charges a higher price then firm $(i$) ($(p_{j}>p_{i}$)) all consumers buy from firm $(i$) and firm $(i$) makes a profit of ($\pi_{i}=(p_{i}-c)D(p_{i})$).
3.  If firms $(i$) and $(j$) charge the same price ($(p_{i}=p_{j}$)) demand is split equally and firm $(i$) makes a profit of $(pi_{i}=(p_{i}-c)\frac{1}{2}D(p_{i})$).



-   Clearly, a higher price does not make much sense, because all customers would remain with firm $(B$).

- Setting the same price means that the two firms share the demand equally and each firm makes a profit of $(\pi_{i}=\frac{(p-c)D(p_{i})}{2}=20D(p)$).
 
- If firm $(A$) charges a price below $(p_{B}$), the highest price it can charge to get all customers is a price that is a little bit lower than the one of firm $(B$), that is, 49.99 million US Dollars. Now Airbus obtains the entire demand and makes a profit of $(\pi_{A}=39.99D(p_{A})$). This profit is higher than the shared profit at equal prices if firm $(A$) charges a price only slightly below the price of firm $(B$).
