Factors include:
- demand: **the number of buyers**
- supply: **number of sellers** 
- output: **quantity of items for sale**
- price: **recent purchase prices** 
- cost of production
- company/exchange policy
- economical/political situation/context



*Price is what you pay, value is what you get*

#### Valuation types:
- Income based approach - *future cashflow* provided
- Asset approach - *based on the cost of production* P.S. products used are priced and it might not provide a good valuation, since prices are used, not valuations.
- Market based approach - *comparative valuation*


#### Pricing types:
- ***value-based pricing***: setting prices of a product or service based on its value <u>perceived by customers</u>.
- ***cost-based pricing***(or cost-plus pricing): determine the selling prices of a company's products based on their production costs 
- etc.


***Definition***: the point where supply and demand intersect is the discovered **spot** market price



#### [[Price discovery]]
Price discovery is the process of finding out just ***where supply and demand lie*** and ***where that market-clearing price may be***.

Intuitively, price discovery is **the dynamic process by which a market incorporates new fundamental information about an asset's value into the asset's price**. 

<u>Theorem</u>: ==A market is **more efficient in the price discovery** process than another market *if it incorporates a larger amount of the new 'value' information more quickly*.==



#### [[Price mechanism]] 
**[source](https://edexceleconomicsrevision.com/home/theme-1-introduction-to-markets-and-market-faliure/price-mechanism/)**

The functions of the price mechanism help to allocate these resources in order to ensure that the market is operating as efficiently as possible (at a point of equilibrium). 
This ensures that there is not an excess of demand or supply in the market. 

The three main functions of the price mechanism include:

###### Rationing 
Any excess demand/supply in the market will be solved through the price mechanism of rationing. For example, if there is an excess of demand in the market there will be upwards pressure on prices. Therefore, ***as suppliers increase their prices the excess demand will be rationed as fewer consumers will be willing and able to buy the good/service at that more expensive price***. As a result, there will be a contraction in demand resulting in the market operating at equilibrium. If there is an excess of supply in the market then there will be downwards pressure on price.

##### Signalling 
The rising prices caused by ***the rationing function*** during excess demand ***send signals to consumers to reduce their demand or stop buying the good/service completely.*** On the other hand, decreasing prices in the market caused by the market getting rid of excess supply sends a signal to consumers to increase their demand for the good/service.

In addition, if prices are falling then this sends a signal to producers that they should leave the market as there is less money to be made. However, if prices are increasing then this price movements acts as a signal to producers that they should either enter the market or increase their production of goods/services into the market. Overall, this helps to prevent excess demand/supply moving the market towards equilibrium.


##### Incentives 
Higher prices in the market caused by the rationing of excess demand incentivises producers to increase the supply of goods/services into the market. This is because the profit made on each good/service sold increases. As a result of this, any rational producer (one that profit maximises) will increase their supply. This extension of supply helps to reduce excess demand and therefore moves the market closer to equilibrium.


Data as a digital asset:
- a data token would be backed by various data products
- but a data product has no supply restrictions since the replication costs are close to 0 (replicate the access only).


*Note*: all classical bidding mechanisms are limited by supply, they all optimize according to the supply(scarcity of the item). but an individual data asset has unlimited supply 


Types of price mechanisms for digital assets:
- bonding curve - reduces the excess demand or supply by bonding the price to a function curve determined by time and/or no. of buyers. 

- [digital goods auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_goods_auction): a seller has an unlimited supply of a certain item. Require known valuations and therefore *truthful mechanism designs* are needed to reveal those.


Innovation part: a new type of auction that combines digital goods auctions with [VCG auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_auction) to reveal the participants valuations through truthful mechanisms. 

Basically a VCG auction for digital goods - http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~peipauj/approximation.pdf




The idea is to show that the price discovery is more efficient using tokenization. Another way to state is how asset tokenization (digitalisation) influences price discovery and provides liquidity. 

*efficiency*: more value-related information is incorporated into the transaction price
