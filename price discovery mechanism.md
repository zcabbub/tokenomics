Factors include:
- demand: **the number of buyers**
- supply: **number of sellers** 
- output: **quantity of items for sale**
- price: **recent purchase prices** 
- cost of production
- company/exchange policy
- economical/political situation/context


price = valuation + supply/demand

*Price is what you pay, value is what you get*

#### Valuation types:
- Income based approach - *future cashflow* provided
- Asset approach - *based on the cost of production* P.S. products used are priced and it might not provide a good valuation, since prices are used, not valuations.
- Market based approach - *comparative valuation*


#### Pricing types:
- ***value-based pricing***: setting prices of a product or service based on its value <u>perceived by customers</u>.
- ***cost-based pricing***(or cost-plus pricing): determine the selling prices of a company's products based on their production costs 
- etc.



***Definition***: the point where supply and demand intersect is the discovered **spot** market price
