#### economic forces (incentives):
**primary**:
- demand/supply
	- HOW?
- exchange rate -> token exchange rate? data valuation as an asset
- interest rate -> staking program to support liquidity

secondary:
- fiscal policy -> Valyu spending 
	- neutral policy
	- expansionary policy (*the one Valyu will approach in the beginning*)
		- probably reinvesting
	- contractory policy
- security
	- in what way? data? token?
