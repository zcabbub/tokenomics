- Place to get agent based models: https://www.comses.net/codebases/

#### Tools
- [swarm](http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Main_Page) platform for simulating agent-based models
- mesa
- NashPy




#### Mechanisms
- offers mechanism -> such as NFTs:
	- asset has a price estimation
	- seller puts his price  - *that usually reflects the demand*
		- separate from the price estimatio
	- the buyers keep placing offers for the item
- price discovery without double auction: 
	- [Price evolution with expectations](https://www.comses.net/codebases/5973351e-688a-4497-a393-1b262a1f836b/releases/1.0.0/)
	- inspiration source for the model [here](https://globalclimateforum.org/2016/12/01/price-dynamics-via-expectations-and-the-role-of-money-therein/)
	- Uses:
		- the best price for token
		- the best token reward for the curators 



Differences
| Data market model           | Sugar producer firm model       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| cannot plan data production | sugar production can be planned |
| profit condition            | non-profit condition            | 


Analogies
| Data market model           | Sugar producer firm model       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| users/curators decide labour(new data) supply | households decide labor supply |
| profit condition            | non-profit condition            | 

TODO continue to follow the model from the paper

my experiments will be based on perfect(without data pricing) and imperfect competition

Goals: 
- see how a data pricing mechanism influences the 



monopolistic competition:
- imperfect substitutes -> 
- if it is harder -> oligopolie, monopol
