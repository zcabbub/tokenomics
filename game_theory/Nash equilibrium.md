at Nash equilibrium if no player wants to unilaterally (done only by one
player) deviate to an alternative strategy.

Def:
– For strategy S by player 1 and T by
player 2, the pair (S,T) is a Nash
equilibrium if S is a best response to
T, and T is a best response to S


It is also unique – no other pair works![[Pasted image 20230305141603.png]]

the strategies are a Nash equilibrium
if, for each i, is player i’s best response to the
strategies by others,
