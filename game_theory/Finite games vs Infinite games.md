*Finite and Infinite Games - James P.  Carse*

- A finite game is played for the purpose of ***winning***, an infinite game for the purpose of ***continuing the play***.

- **Finite** games are those instrumental activities - from sports to politics to wars - in which the participants obey **rules**, recognize boundaries and announce winners and losers.
- The **Infinite** game there is only one - includes any authentic interaction, from touching to culture, that changes rules, plays with boundaries and exists solely for the purpose of continuing the game.
- A finite player seeks ***power***; the infinite one displays ***self-sufficient strength***.

- Finite games are ***theatrical*** - performed according to a script of some kind
- infinite ones are ***dramatic*** - enacted in the present
