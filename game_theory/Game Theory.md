Def: A game consists of three things.
– (1) A set of players
– (2) Each player has set of options how to behave
called strategies
– (3) For each choice of strategies, each player receives
a payoff from the game.


The players are indexed by i where i ∈{1,...,n}

$s_i ∈S_i$

Thus, a n-player game is specified by the players’
strategy space and utility functions (s1,..., sn )

G = {S1,...,Sn;u1,...,un}
