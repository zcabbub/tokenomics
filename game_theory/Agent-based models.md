#### Questions:
- [x] create different types of agents in Mesa?
- [x] read best practices ([pag. 44 mesa docs])
- [ ] read useful snippets 
- [ ] read - has [Schelling point](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/) 
- [x] see Mesa's schelling point implementation example 
- [ ] Schelling point example explanation: https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-mesa-agent-based-modeling-in-python-bcb0596e1c9a
- [ ] examples: https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/main/examples

Implementation:
- [ ] turn it into a CLI tool
- [ ] create a simple 2 party sytem buyer seller 
	- [ ] assume that buyers don t move or reverse
	- [ ] buyers = curators
- [ ] add curator
- [ ] add centralized party 
- [ ] radius is proportional with wealth
	- *might be a problem with really big differences*
